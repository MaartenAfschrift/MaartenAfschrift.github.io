# 3D simulations ankle-foot exoskeleton: subject 1 (Report 1) 

Here you can find the videos of the simulated walking motions.

## Video walking in normal, passive and active conditions

## Comparison simulations

Summary of differences in kinematics between the simulations of normal walking (blue), walking with the passive exoskeleton (dark) and walking with the active exoskeleton (orange). The video is played at 30% of the real speed.

**View1- sagital plane:**  Front = Normal walking (blue?), Middle = Passive (brown), Back = Active (orange)

**View2: Frontal plane:** Left = Normal walking (blue?) , Middle = Passive (brown), Right = Active (orange)

## Results sensitivity analysis

Here can see the predicted walking motion in the powered conditions with the default torque profile (100%), the metabolically best profile (170%) and an extreme assistance profile (240%).

Comparison assistance profiles: 
**View 1:** Left = 240%, Middle = 170%, Right = 100%
