We aim at developing predictive simulations of motion for personalized optimization of human movement. Model-based optimal treatment or training design is challenging due to (1) the difficulty to capture the complexity and inter-subject variability of the neuro-musculoskeletal system in a model, and (2) the high computational cost of numerical methods that account for the complexity of the neuro-musculoskeletal system. I therefore focus on the development of

- neuro-musculoskeletal models
- numerical methods for analysis and simulation of movement

Neuro-musculoskeletal models describe both the musculoskeletal and motor control system since human motion results from the interaction between motor control and musculoskeletal dynamics.

We use an optimal control framework based on direct collocation to solve for neural controls that drive our simulations of human movement.

On this webpage we share numerical methods for analysis and simualtion of human movement.
