I am a postdoctoral researcher at KU Leuven and assistant professor at the VU Amsterdam with a passion for biomechanics, neural control of movement, neuro-musculoskeletal modelling and wearable robotics.


Biomechanics and neural control of human movement is probably the most general term to describe my research interest and intentions. I'm mainly using a blended experimental and computer modelling approach to predict the influence of specific interventions on human movement. For example, I'm currently identifying balance control mechanisms in humans by measuring the neural response to perturbations during standing and walking. The resulting models of human balance control will be useful in computer-aided design of (bio-inspired) exoskeleton controllers that cooperate with humans in the control of balance during locomotion.
