<h1 id="phd-defense-maarten-afschrift">PhD Defense Maarten Afschrift</h1>
<p>I will present my PhD in dutch (for familly and friends) and the questioning afterwards will be in english (for colleagues and jury members). In order to <em>“keep the church in the middle”</em> (belgian proverb meaning I want to make everybody happy <em>but will probably not succeed</em>) I made my slides in English.</p>
<p>This document contains some small notes and the most important slides of my PhD Presentation. I have kept the text concise to limit the reading effort and only explain things that are not on the slides. I hope you can follow and enjoy the presentation at least little bit this way.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome</p>

<p>High incidence of falls in the elderly + definition of stability</p>

<p>The human skeletal system is unstable due to high position of COM above a small BOS.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide87.PNG" alt="img" /><figcaption>img</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Muscles, controlled by the nervous system increase the stability of the skeletal system.</p>
<p>Sensory information is integrated in the nervous system. In a control structure, sensory information is compared to the desired state, which results in muscle excitations to activate muscles that generate force to correct instability</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide144.PNG" alt="img" /><figcaption>img</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here I explain that there are 2 mechanisms for balance control</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the COP in the foot using an ankle torque</li>
<li>angular acceleration segment with big inertia to accelerate COM (tilt GRF vector)</li>
</ul>
<p>This resulted in three strategies that are commonly observed</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide167.PNG" alt="img" /><figcaption>img</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Explanation of the different strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>ankle strategy = COP strategy (muscle activity to control ankle movement + lock other joints)</li>
<li>hip strategy = inertial strategy.</li>
<li>Stepping strategy = adjust base of support</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<p>Capability to recover from perturbation (i.e. stability): ankle &lt; hip &lt; stepping</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide207.PNG" alt="Intro walking" /><figcaption>Intro walking</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ankle and stepping strategy are also used during walking, but mainly control of balance needed in frontal plane (on less in sagittal)</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide228.PNG" alt="InfluenceAging" /><figcaption>InfluenceAging</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Age-related changes in</p>
<ul>
<li>muscle function</li>
<li>sensory function</li>
<li>cognitive function</li>
</ul>
<p>Hard to identify influence of these changes on stability using experiments. Predictive simulations can be used to get a better understanding (or at least generate hypothesis for experiments)</p>
<h2 id="general-methods">General methods</h2>
<figure>
<img src="Slide251.PNG" alt="Data analysis" /><figcaption>Data analysis</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Motion capture, EMG, force plates were used to measure the balance control strategies of young and older subjects after a perturbation during standing and walking.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide315.PNG" alt="Methods_Forward" /><figcaption>Methods_Forward</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Forward simulation workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>mathematical description of mechanics (muscles + skeleton) and simple description of feedback control</li>
<li>By imposing age-related constraints, we have mathematical relation between aging and stability of the different strategies (causal relation within limitations of the model)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="standing-balance-control">Standing balance control</h2>
<p>Study 1 and 3 about standing balance control:</p>

<p>Shift from ankle to hip and stepping strategy with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased perturbation magnitude</li>
<li>age</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Slide344.PNG" alt="ForwardTaskGoal" /><figcaption>ForwardTaskGoal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Predictive simulations with effort related and stability related task level goals (optimal feedback control simulations)</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide363.PNG" alt="AgingForward" /><figcaption>AgingForward</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We evaluated in simulation if limitations in muscle force, functional base of support and sensory noise can explain why elderly use a hip strategy (and young subjects an ankle strategy)</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide389.PNG" alt="MechanicalConstraints" /><figcaption>MechanicalConstraints</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When constraining the functional base of support and the maximal ankle and hip torque, we found changes in the postural response. But the values measured in the elderly could not explain the shift from ankle to hip strategy observed in the experimental data</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide400.PNG" alt="Sensory noise" /><figcaption>Sensory noise</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sensory noise can explain shift from ankle to hip strategy in the elderly.</p>
<p>But changes in task level goal can also explain the age-related differences (i.e. elderly might select a strategy that is more stable, but less efficient)</p>
<h2 id="walking-balance-control">Walking balance control</h2>
<figure>
<img src="Slide401.PNG" alt="Walking balance control" /><figcaption>Walking balance control</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I had two main goals for my research on walking balance control</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain insights in the use of ankle and stepping strategies during walking (less is known in literature). Focus on how control strategy changes during the gait cycle (in young subjects)</li>
<li>Evaluate if mechanisms identified above change with aging (young and older subjects)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Slide437.PNG" alt="Outward stepping strategy" /><figcaption>Outward stepping strategy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Explanation of outward stepping strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase in stride width to compensate outward loss of balance</li>
<li>increase activity of stance and swing leg hip abductor muscles (EMG)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Slide460.PNG" alt="Inward stepping strategy" /><figcaption>Inward stepping strategy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Explanation of inward stepping strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outward not possible, because right leg is on the ground during loss of balance</li>
<li>Cross over of the left leg (decrease stride width)</li>
<li>Small increase in left hip abductor muscle (EMG)</li>
<li>Large increase in tibialis anterior activity</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Slide479.PNG" alt="Results Data analysis" /><figcaption>Results Data analysis</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Overview of results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stepping strategy changes during gait cycle (in response to the same perturbation)</li>
<li>reactive muscle activity tibialis and gluteus medius changes during the gait cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>Main question: how does the muscle activity contribute to the control of balance (is it important) ? And what is the reason behind the modulation of muscle activity ?</p>
<p>Need for simulations</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide498.PNG" alt="Forward simulation walking" /><figcaption>Forward simulation walking</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this slide a very brief introduction to the forward simulations of walking:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Computation of muscle excitations that reconstruct normal unperturbed walking (tracking simulation)</li>
<li>Add platform translation to forward integration of normal walking = passive response</li>
<li>Add platform translation + measured muscle response (EMG) to integration = active response</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="Slide514.PNG" alt="Simulation outward stepping" /><figcaption>Simulation outward stepping</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The simulation approach was used to evaluate the role of the hip abductors activity (EMG) after the outward perturbation (outward stepping)</p>
<ul>
<li>Swing leg GM abducts the hip and controls outward foot placement</li>
<li>Stance leg GM also contributes to outward foot placement. It tilts the pelvis, stretches the swing leg hip abductor muscles, these generate more force for the same activation. As a results, also swing leg hip abduction moment and outward foot placement</li>
</ul>
<p>(This similar mechanical action of both muscles is also reflected in variability in EMG between the two muscles responses)</p>
<figure>
<img src="Slide527.PNG" alt="GM stance action is slower" /><figcaption>GM stance action is slower</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Simulation results: when the perturbation was applied a bit later in gait cycle</p>
<ul>
<li>still outward stepping strategy (data analysis)</li>
<li>Only increase in swing leg gluteus medius and nog stance leg (data analysis, EMG)</li>
<li>Simulation showed that action of the stance leg GM is too slow to adjust foot placement here (e.g. perturbation is closer to heel contact). This explains lack on stance leg EMG in the measurement. (this is somehow represented in the control/nervous system)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Slide548.PNG" alt="Simulation inward directed perturbation" /><figcaption>Simulation inward directed perturbation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Simulation results of inward directed perturbations:</p>
<ul>
<li>gluteus medius stance leg activity is contra-intuitive. this contributes to outward and not inward foot placement. In simulations, we showed that this activity is needed to prevent inter-limb collision.</li>
<li>In simulation, we showed that tibialis anterior activity causes inversion in the foot and moves the COP outwards =&gt; lateral ankle strategy</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Slide587.PNG" alt="Aging walking balance control" /><figcaption>Aging walking balance control</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the next study I evaluated how aging influences the stepping and lateral ankle strategy during walking (data analysis young and older subjects)</p>
<p>Outward stepping:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No changes in foot placement</p></li>
<li><p>No changes in reactive gluteus medius and tibialis anterior activity</p>
<p>( A bit remarkable that they also use stance leg GM, this mechanisms is apparantly not too slow)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Inward stepping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased adjustment of foot placement in elderly (inward stepping)</li>
<li>Decrease in reactive tibialis anterior activity ! Simulations suggests decrease in COP movement, this is also what we observed in measured COP data (graph right).</li>
</ul>
